				<p>The first two generations were individual gods, and the next five were pairs of brother and sister gods who were also married. In the Kojiki, there were 12 deities that made the Kamiyoyano.</p>

				<p>This is another set of books that states that rather than emerging after the Earth and Heaven, the Kamiyoyano came after the Universe was created.</p>
				<p>It also says that the first three generations were single deities, and the 5 generations that followed came to be as couples.</p>
